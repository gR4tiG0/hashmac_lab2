# hashmac_lab2
Sources by Prikhodko Yuriy FB-12 for lab2 in hashmac course. IPT 2024.
Generated tables are more 2gb, so I wont be uploading them on git.
Source file `hellman.c` is well commented, so I thing no additional documentation is needed.

To build on linux, you will need blake2 library. 
To build just run `make` in source directory. 
Functionality is not prompted in any way and must be regulated by modifying parts of main function.
